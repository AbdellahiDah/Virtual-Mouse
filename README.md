# Build-An-AI-Virtual-Mouse-With-OpenCV
In the course of my work exploring practical real-time computer vision applications, I have successfully implemented a hands-free webcam-based controller for the computer mouse using the OpenCV library in Python. This project enables users to control their computers without the need for any physical peripherals, reminiscent of the Iron Man interface! The process involves obtaining a live camera feed with OpenCV, estimating hand poses with MediaPipe Handsâ€”a machine learning-based open-source framework that infers 3D landmarks of the hand in real-time from single frames, without the need for advanced hardware acceleration, making it suitable even for mobile phones. Subsequently, I have established a simulated mouse movement in response to hand poses using the AutoPy automation module.
